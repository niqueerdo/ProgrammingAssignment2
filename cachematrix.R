## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below is a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        invrs <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                invrs <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) invrs <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() invrs
        list(set = set, 
             get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        invrs <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(invrs)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(invrs)
        }
        mat <- x$get()
        invrs <- solve(mat, ...)
        x$setinverse(invrs)
        invrs
}
